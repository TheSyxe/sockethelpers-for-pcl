_This changelog refers to nuget package releases._

#### 0.0.1-alpha (2015-04-08)

First published to NuGet. This is all alpha stuff - APIs are likely to change.
Includes:

- **Service Discovery** - See the `Discovery` namespace, overview [here](http://ryandavis.io/service-discovery-in-mobile-apps/) and sample code in the [README](https://github.com/rdavisau/sockethelpers-for-pcl/blob/master/README.md).
- **Typed Message Transmission** - See the `Messaging` namespace and sample code in the [README](https://github.com/rdavisau/sockethelpers-for-pcl/blob/master/README.md).
- **Hub Routing** - Also hidden in the `Messaging` namespace. No sample code for this yet. Basic functionality works, but this is the least developed part of the library.
