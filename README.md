#Socket Helpers Plugin for Xamarin and Windows (PCL)

This library aims to provide useful functionality around the base [sockets-for-pcl](https://github.com/rdavisau/sockets-for-pcl/) classes, including hub-style communications, custom protocol helpers and support for typed messaging, and error handling/life cycle and reliability options. 

Code is coming soon..
